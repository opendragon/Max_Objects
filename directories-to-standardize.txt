Standardization:¥ set tabs to 2 (use exported settings)¥ replace 'as???' with 'static_cast<???>', except where '???' is a fundamental data type¥ replace 'asMethod' with 'reinterpret_cast<method>'¥ eliminate excess '{'/'}' pairs¥ move 'for' variables into the 'for' header¥ look for inlining opportunities¥ newlines after 'break', 'continue', 'return'¥ don't split logic expressions or 'for' loops over multiple lines¥ replace 'typedef struct xx_' with 'struct xx'directories to be C++ standardized:Common Code         ==> donebqt                 ==> donecaseShift           ==> done & testedchanges             ==> done & testedcompares            ==> done & testeddataType            ==> done & testeddoPlugin            ==> doneeyes                ==> donefileLogger          ==> done & testedgcd                 ==> done & testedgvp100              ==> doneldp1550             ==> donelisten              ==> done & testedmap1d               ==> done & testedmemory              ==> done & testedmtc                 ==> done & testednotX                ==> done & testedpfsm                ==> done & testedplugin library      ==> donequeue               ==> done & testedrcx                 ==> done & testedserialX             ==> done & testedspaceball           ==> donespeak               ==> done & testedtcp                 ==> done & testedVabs                ==> done & testedVceiling            ==> done & testedVcos                ==> done & testedVdistance           ==> done & testedVdrop               ==> done & testedVlength             ==> done & testedVmean               ==> done & testedVreduce             ==> done & testedVsegment            ==> done & testedx10                 ==> doneeye development     ==> doneplugin development  ==> done
