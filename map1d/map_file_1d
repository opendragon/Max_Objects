# The format is: <open> <lower> <upper> <close> <output> ;
# where <open> is either '[' or '(' and <close> is either ']' or ')';
# <lower> is a number or the symbol '-°' (option-5) or '-inf';
# <upper> is a number or the symbol '°' (option-5) or '+°' or 'inf' or '+inf';
# <output> is what to return on a match;
# <output> can contain the symbol '$' which is replaced by the input;
# value or the symbol '$$' which is replaced by the offset of the input;
# value from <lower> - the input value is returned instead of the;
# offset if <lower> is unbounded;
