  `$\infty$' or `$+\infty$', which indicate an unbounded value.
  The symbol `*' indicates a ``don't care'' value, which will match anything.
  \emph{output} is a list of values to return on a successful match.

  \objListCmdItem{delete}{index}
  Removes the range with the given index from the loaded set of ranges.

  \objListCmdItem{dump}{}
  Retrieves all the ranges as a sequence of lists starting with the symbol `range'.

\objItemFile[]

\begin{quote}
The map file is composed of a set of ranges.
Comments start with the `\#' character and end with the `;' character.
Ranges are either open (don't include the boundary value) or closed (the boundary value is included),
and have boundary values that are integers, floating-point numbers, or infinities.
An open range is indicated by a parenthesis, or round bracket, and a closed range by a square bracket.
A range declaration is in the following form:

\centerline{\emph{`*'} or \emph{b1 left right b2} \emph{`*'} or \emph{b3 bottom top b4} \emph{`*'} or \emph{b5 forward back b6 output}}

\emph{b1}, \emph{b3} and \emph{b5} are either `[' or `(' and \emph{b2}, \emph{b4} and \emph{b6} are
either `]' or `)';
\emph{left}, \emph{bottom} and \emph{forward} are floating-point numbers, integers or one of the symbols `$-$inf' or
`$-\infty$', which indicate an unbounded value;
\emph{right}, \emph{top} and \emph{back} are floating-point numbers, integers or one of the symbols `inf', `$+$inf',
`$\infty$' or `$+\infty$', which indicate an unbounded value.
The symbol `*' indicates a ``don't care'' value, which will match anything.
\emph{output} is a list of values to return on a successful match.
The output list can contain the symbol `\$' to indicate the input values or the symbol `\$\$' to
indicate the offset of the input values from the vector (\emph{left} \emph{bottom} \emph{forward}) of the
matching range.
The output list can also contain the symbols `\$x', `\$y' or `\$z' to indicate the first, second or third
input value, or the symbols `\$\$x', `\$\$y' or `\$\$z' to indicate the offset of the first input value from
the \emph{left} value of the matching range, the offset of the second input value from the \emph{bottom} value
of the matching range or the offset of the third input value from the \emph{forward} value of the matching
range.
If \emph{left}, \emph{bottom} or \emph{forward} is unbounded, the corresponding input value is returned rather
than the offset.
Note that the order of the range declarations is critical---the first range that matches the input
is used, and overlaps between range declarations are ignored.
